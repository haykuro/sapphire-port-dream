  * Version 'H' is sourced from HTC for the Chunghwa phone.
  * Version 'G' is sourced from Google.

The latest Radio is [2.22.19.23](http://sapphire-port-dream.googlecode.com/files/Saphire-Radio-Update%20%28rc33%29.zip)

There is a newer **SPL** that has additional keypresses for rebooting the phone, as well as progress indicators while flashing.
It is located [here](http://sapphire-port-dream.googlecode.com/files/spl-signed.zip)

# Issues/Bug/Feature Request #
**Please add any feature requests/bug reporting on the [issues tab](http://code.google.com/p/sapphire-port-dream/issues/list)** **_AFTER_** you check for an existing issue. Please think about the issue you are reporting and ask yourself if it sounds like an OS problem or something haykuro can fix. The issues list is growing extremely fast and more than half of the issues are either duplicates or are not something we can fix. Also remember that third party apps not working is something the app developer needs to fix. They need to make their code compatible with Android 1.5, and not vice versa.
